# readme-generator

The goal of this project is to develop a useful tool for developers that dynamically generates a very important part/ finisher of any project, a README file. This README file generator utilizes the inquirer package which makes it possible to retrieve user input using the command-line. Below is a video demonstration of how the README file is generated based on input. For this example, test input values were used for the questions.

As seen above in the video, the generated README file will contain sections that appropriately list the following about the project:
-  Title.
-  Brief description.
-  Install guide.
-  How to use.
-  How can others contribute.
-  How to test.
-  What kind of license.
-  User's GitHub username and E-mail.
